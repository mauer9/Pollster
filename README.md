# Pollster

## Introduction

Django poll app is a full featured polling app. You have to register in this
app to show the polls and to vote. If you already voted you can not vote again.
Only the owner of a poll can add poll , edit poll, update poll, delete poll,
add choice, update choice, delete choice and end a poll. If a poll is ended it
can not be voted. Ended poll only shows user the final result of the poll.
There is a search option for polls. Also user can filter polls by name,
publish date, and by number of voted. Pagination will work even after applying
